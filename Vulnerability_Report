📄 FUTURE_CS_01 – Vulnerability Assessment Report
Security Assessment Report
Task: FUTURE_CS_01 – Web Application Security Testing
Intern Name: Vijay Kumar Reddy Urimindi
Track: Cyber Security
Organization: Future Interns
Date: 13 July 2025

🔍 Executive Summary
This report summarizes the findings from a web application penetration test performed on DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App). The objective was to identify vulnerabilities aligned with OWASP Top 10 risks, document proof of concept (PoC), and suggest mitigation strategies. This hands-on testing was performed as part of my Cyber Security Internship at Future Interns.

🧪 Methodology
The following steps were followed:

DVWA deployed locally using Docker

Burp Suite and Firefox DevTools used to intercept and manipulate requests

Manual payload injection for SQLi and XSS

Screenshots captured for PoC documentation

Findings mapped to OWASP Top 10

🚨 Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection
Category: Injection (OWASP A03)

Location: SQL Injection module (User ID input)

Payload Used:
1' OR '1'='1
Result: Authentication bypass; database dump displayed

Impact: High – attacker can access user data without credentials

Mitigation:

Use parameterized SQL queries

Input validation and sanitization

Avoid displaying raw database errors

🚨 Vulnerability 2: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Category: Cross-Site Scripting (OWASP A07)

Location: Stored XSS module

Payload Used:
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Result: JavaScript executed in victim’s browser upon loading the page

Impact: Medium – can be used for session hijacking or phishing

Mitigation:

Encode output before rendering

Sanitize user inputs

Set CSP headers and enable HTTPOnly on cookies

📋 OWASP Top 10 Mapping
OWASP ID	 Vulnerability	 Found	Severity
A03	     Injection (SQLi)	 ✅	    High
A07         	XSS (Stored) ✅  	Medium

🧠 Skills Gained
Web application vulnerability scanning (manual & tool-based)

Ethical hacking with Burp Suite, Docker, Firefox DevTools

Secure coding awareness

Security documentation and OWASP mapping

🧾 Tools Used
Burp Suite Community Edition

SQLMap

Firefox Developer Tools

DVWA

Docker & Docker Compose

Kali Linux

✅ Conclusion
This task provided a deep understanding of real-world web security flaws. The hands-on testing experience reinforced OWASP principles and ethical hacking methods. The findings were successfully documented in a professional format as required by Future Interns.
